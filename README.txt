# TUESDAY's Assignment - 

    Upon opening the app, 
    users are presented with a homepage that displays the latest published news stories from different categories such as: 
    business, politics, entertainment, sports, health, and more. 
    The user can then select a category of their interest, and 
    the app will display a list of articles from that particular category. 

    Upon logging into the app, verified users can
    create new articles, edit their existing articles that are in the draft phase, 
    and delete articles that have not been submitted for review. 
    Once an article has been submitted for review, it cannot be edited or deleted by the user. 
    The app should provide a simple and intuitive user interface that makes it easy for users to manage their articles.
